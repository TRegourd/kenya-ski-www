Due to Kenya's geographical location, our on-snow training primarily takes place in Europe, specifically in Austria and Italy, where we have established partnerships with training centers. However, we conduct extensive dry-land training, roller skiing, and strength conditioning in Kenya throughout the year to ensure our athletes remain physically peak condition.
